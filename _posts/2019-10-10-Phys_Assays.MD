## Pipeline for geoduck physiology (oxidative stress, total protein, & condition index)
NOTE: the following protocol was followed in analysis of juvenile geoduck (~5-8mm shell length)
from an OA experiment completed in summer 2019. Juvenile geoduck (whole animals) were snap frozen in LN2 at the hatchery
and stored at -80°C until later analysis.

### 1.) Sample prep
#### **Homogenize samples / record homogenate volume(s)**

:**PREPARATION::**
  - label four 1.5 ml epindorf tubes per sample ID (four aliquots of homogenized tissue; n = 4 phys measurements)
  - chill PBS before use
  - use cold beads (stored at -20°C) to hold a 25ml beaker of cold PBS and samples
  - divide bead bin for four tube destinations
  - label four storage boxes for four assays = total antioxidant capcacity (TAC),
  condition index/AFDW (CI), lipid peroxidation (LP), and total protein (TP)

**HOMOGENIZE FROZEN SAMPLES:**

- add **200 µl cold PBS** to the sample tube
- homogenize samples **thoroughly!**
- pipette **600ul cold PBS to rinse** the homogenizer blade **into** the sample tube

*Important note:* volume of PBS used here (e.g. 200 µl + 600 µl = 800 µl) is dependent on
(1) the volume needed per sample in downstream assays and
(2) volume needed to rinse *all* sample from the homogenizer

- **clean homogenizer** - *before every subsequent sample AND when finished...*
submerge the the homogenizer in 25 ml beaker of
DI --> bleach --> DI --> >70% ethanol --> DI. Dry with Kimwipe.
Run the homogenizer for 1-2 seconds before the next sample

:**TOTAL HOMOGENATE VOLUME (HV):**
- *using a 1000 µl (1ml) pipette* **meausure HV** of
the homogenized sample (e.g. homogenized geoduck + 800ul cold PBS; **~800-900 µl**)
- **record** HV and tube/sample ID in datasheet

- pipette four aliquots in **seperate labeled tubes** for the following:

  *IMPORTANT! **vortex** the HV epindorf tube **between each aliquot**!*

    1.) 100ul - **total protein (TP)** need 25 µl per sample in microplate assay (50 µl in duplicate)

    2.) 80ul - **total antioxidant capacity (TAC)** need 20 µl per sample in microplate assay (40 µl in duplicate)

    3.) 350 ul - **lipid peroxidation (LP)** need 300 µl for TBARS acid treatment;
    150ul per sample in microplate assay (300 µl in duplicate)

    4.) 270 - 400 µl - **condition index/AFDW (CI)** the remaining sample can be used for CI
    (e.g. 100 µl(TP) + 80 µl(TAC) + 350 µl(LP) = 530 µl; 800 ul - 530 µl = 270 µl)

- place homoegized samples in labeled storage box and store for later analysis

*Note*: TAC, LP, and TP in -80°C; CI samples can stored in anthing ≤ 4°C

### 2.) Target measurements:
###### I. Total protein
#### Assay: Pierce(TM) BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific)

###### II. Conditionin index

###### III. Total antioxidant capcacity (CSR to oxidative stress)
#### Assay: OxiSelect(TM) Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) Assay Kit (Cell Biolabs Inc.)
###### IV. Lipid peroxidation (oxidative damage)
#### Assay: Parameter(TM) TBARS Assay (R&D Systems Inc.)
