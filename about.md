### About
Estuaries and coasts write an ideal recipe for marine research, education, and societal integration to work harmoneously. I am particularly inspired by semi-sessile invertebrates that lack effective mobility to evade effects of anthropogenic activity. Previous research used non-invasive heartbeat rate sensors in-situ as a proxy for whole animal metabolic activity under diel-cycling hypoxia ([Volkenborn lab](https://you.stonybrook.edu/samuelgurr/)) . "Bio-sensing" via real-time physiological activity (e.g. bivalve cardiac and valve gape response) can display a charasmatic perpective for water quality standardization and habitat restoration amoung urban systems. I used such concepts to transform heavy STEM topics into interactive exhibits for public consumption ([cited in New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/nyregion/new-york-today-hudson-river-fish.html)).

I am PhD student at Univeristy of Rhode Island in the Putnam Lab. My current research is focused on the Pacific geoduck (Panopea generosa).
