## Goals for 2023

## (1)	RESEARCH AND WRITING GOALS

---------------------------------- 


## I.	Manuscripts
### i.	Field mussel energetics project: 
 -	(in review)
 
### ii.	Barnacle energetics project
 -	Finalize all tables and figures
 -	Draft manuscript
 -      Finalize and submit

### iii.	Alma mussel energetics project
About: L. Alma and J.Padilla-Gami√±o grew mussels for two 6 month periods and measured respiration at the end of each interval. Build an energetic model that predicts cost and growth and evaluate the relationship between estimated and observed growth. 
 -	Finalize all tables and figures
 -	Draft manuscript
 -      Finalize and submit
 -  Complete the following:
     -	Finalize nonlinear fits involving temperature, pH, and mussel mass
     -  Finalize energetic unit conversions and estimate cost (J) and SFG (J)
     -  Write methods for the paper on how these estimates were done.

## II.	Experiment(s), Measurements, and Analyses  

---------------------------------- 

### i.	Atlantic surfclam sediment porewater and energetics modeling project: 
 -  Team: monitor transplanted surfclams at 2 sites, ongoing monitoring at 4 sites
 -  Shell hash experimental treatment comparison
      - Carbonate content of sediment with and without shell hash
      - Team: Carbonate chemistry of sediment porewater with and without shell hash
	-	Work with collaborators to compare summer gene expression of surfclams with and without shell hash at 4 sites. 
 -  Finish lab processing of samples
      - POM and TSM (particulate matter and total suspended matter)
      - Sediment cores (April collection from transplant sites)
      - Dissections of surfclams
  - Biodeposition measurements
  - Modeling and synthesis components
      - Coordinate with Emilien and gather datasets to predict feeding and growth rates for both the field monitoring project and the transplant experiment
      - Read up on energetics modeling work predicting maximum size and annual growth rates (D. Munroe) 

 
		
## III.	Overall Goals This Year..

(1)	Sharpen writing and speaking skills
- Manuscript publication (More detail above)
- Seek out teaching opportunities
- Present at scientific meetings

(2)	Coding and ecological modeling product creation
- Develop a pipeline for energetics modeling code so it can be easily reused. Include reference to published code in manuscript.   
- Use linear mixed effects models, and mechanistic model simulations. Publish reports online with figures and code imbedded into one report. 
- Reading: Atlantic surfclam population and growth models (especially models that include mortality)

(3)	Bioinformatics
- Collaborate with NOAA bioinformatics experts to investigate gene expression. 
- Interpret TaqSeq data
- Reading: general transcriptomics / gene expression networks 

(4)	Applications for faculty positions and grant proposals in quantitative ecology / theoretical biology / ecophysiology  
- 	NOAA OAP (LOI submitted)
-   OAE-PRF NSF postdoc grant application, Nov 10, 2023 (https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22628/nsf22628.htm#awd_info)
-   Faculty applications (October - December 2023)
