## Goals for 2024

## (1)	RESEARCH AND WRITING GOALS

---------------------------------- 

## I.	Manuscripts
### i.	Barnacle energetics project
 -	Finalize all tables and figures
 -	Draft manuscript
 -      Finalize and submit

### ii.	Alma mussel energetics project
About: L. Alma and J.Padilla-Gami√±o grew mussels for two 6 month periods and measured respiration at the end of each interval. Build an energetic model that predicts cost and growth and evaluate the relationship between estimated and observed growth. 
 -	Finalize all tables and figures, incorporate into main text, update discussion on metabolism and physiology
 -	Draft manuscript
 -      Finalize and submit
 -  Complete the following:
     -	Finalize nonlinear fits involving temperature, pH, and mussel mass
     -  Finalize energetic unit conversions and estimate cost (J) and SFG (J)
     -  Write methods for the paper on how these estimates were done.

### iii. Surfclam data paper
About: Summary of results of transplant project, including the effect of shell hash on carbonate chemistry
 - Transcriptomics analysis
 - Finalize tables and figures
 - Write results section
 - Write intro and discussion section

### iii. Surfclam DEB model paper
About: Temporal variability of carbonate chemistry vs. mean carbonate chemistry and surfclam growth
 - Update model to include all surfclam collection timepoints
 - Update carbonate chemistry calculations to include hourly estimates
 - Write methods and results
 - Write intro and discussion section
 - Communicate with past energetics model developers (D. Munroe, E. Pousse)

## II.	Experiment(s), Measurements, and Analyses  

---------------------------------- 

### i.	Modeling and synthesis components
 - Model updates described above

		
## III.	Overall Goals This Year..

(1)	Sharpen writing and speaking skills
- Manuscript publication (Work on improving intro + discussion framing for audience)
- Seek out teaching/workshop facilitation opportunities (e.g. EDAP, ASOM)

(2)	Coding and ecological modeling product creation
- Develop a pipeline for energetics modeling code so it can be easily reused. Include reference to published code in manuscript.   
- Use linear mixed effects models, and mechanistic model simulations. Publish reports online with figures and code imbedded into one report. 
- Reading: Atlantic surfclam population and growth models (especially models that include mortality)

(3)	Bioinformatics
- Interpret TaqSeq data
- Reading: general transcriptomics / gene expression networks 

(4)	Applications for permanent positions and grant proposals in quantitative ecology / theoretical biology / ecophysiology  
-   Government agency openings integrating biological knowledge into management, climate research, and/or capacity building (NOAA, USAID)
-   OAE-PRF NSF postdoc grant application, Nov 10, 2023 (https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22628/nsf22628.htm#awd_info)
-   Faculty applications (October - December 2024)
