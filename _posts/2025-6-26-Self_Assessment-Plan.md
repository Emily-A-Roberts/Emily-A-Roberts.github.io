## Goals for 2025

## (1)	RESEARCH AND WRITING GOALS

---------------------------------- 

## I.	Manuscripts
### i.	Surfclam data paper
About: Summary of results of transplant project, including the effect of shell hash on carbonate chemistry
 - Finalize tables and figures (restructure figures)
 - Write discussion section

### ii.	Balanus glandula thermal performance curves
About: Repeated measures non-linear fits for 3 sites X 2 metrics. Confidence intervals for Topt
 - QC step for feeding data
 - Comparison of curves with AIC & BIC
 - Try bootstrapping / delta method for Topt

### iii. Alma mussel energetics project
About: L. Alma and J.Padilla-Gami√±o grew mussels for two 6 month periods and measured respiration at the end of each interval. Build an energetic model that predicts cost and growth and evaluate the relationship between estimated and observed growth. 
 - The analysis is completed, but the manuscript intro & disussion needs to be modified to include physiology framing

### iiii. Surfclam DEB model paper
About: Temporal variability of carbonate chemistry vs. mean carbonate chemistry and surfclam growth
 - Update model to include all surfclam collection timepoints
 - Update carbonate chemistry calculations to include hourly estimates
 - Write methods and results
 - Write intro and discussion section
 - Communicate with past energetics model developers (D. Munroe, E. Pousse)

## II.	Experiment(s), Measurements, and Analyses  

---------------------------------- 

### i.	Sea scallop and surfclam larval papers
 - Lab experiments (completed)
 - Video analyses using ML
 - Hydrographics & ocean indicators
		
## III.	Overall Goals This Year..

---------------------------------- 

(1)	Sharpen writing and speaking skills
- Manuscript publication 
- Teaching

(2)	Coding and ecological modeling product creation
- Improve familiarity with Bash scripting for AI/ML swimming behavior project  

(4)	Applications for permanent positions and grant proposals in quantitative ecology / theoretical biology / ecophysiology
