# Goals for 2022

### Credit: Thank you Sam Gurr for the template for this self assessment! 

## (1)	RESEARCH AND WRITING GOALS

---------------------------------- 


## I.	Manuscripts


### i.	Lab mussel energetics project: 
 -	resubmit to MEPS by April 15
 -	edit and submit (fingers crossed)
 
### ii.	Field mussel energetics project:
 -	Finalize and submit by May 1
 
 ### iii.	Barnacle energetics project
 -	Finalize all tables and figures by May 15
 -	Draft manuscript by June 1st 2022
 -  Finalize and submit by June 15 2022



## II.	Experiment(s), Measurements, and Analyses  

---------------------------------- 

### i.	Atlantic surfclam sediment porewater and energetics modeling project: 
 -	Team: install enclosures and outplant surfclams at 4 sites
 -  Shell hash experimental treatment comparison
      - Carbonate content of sediment with and without shell hash
      - Team: Carbonate chemistry of sediment porewater with and without shell hash
	-	Work with collaborators to compare summer gene expression of surfclams with and without shell hash at 4 sites. 
  - Develop sediment carbonate chemistry protocol for monitoring experiment and transplant experiment
  - Analyze total suspended solids for monitoring experiment and transplant experiment
  Note: We are still confirming the possiblity of working at 2 of the 4 sites (Provincetown and Barnstable), so we may need to downscale. 
  
  Other aspects of this project (dependant on field logistical limitations):
  - Biodeposition measurements: Shadow sea scallop group to become familiar with the equipment, protocol, and timing to later use in the field.  
  - Coordinate with Emilien and gather datasets to predict growth rates for both the field monitoring project and the transplant experiment
  - Read up on energetics modeling work predicting maximum size and annual growth rates (J. Munroe) 
  

### ii. Collaboration with L. Alma on energetics of mussels in Puget Sound. 

About: L. Alma and J.Padilla-Gami√±o grew mussels for two 6 month periods and measured respiration at the end of each interval.
Build an energetic model that predicts cost and growth and evaluate the relationship between estimated and observed growth. 
Finalize figures in spring 2022.
Finalize manuscript in summer 2022. 

 -	Finalize nonlinear fits involving temperature, pH, and mussel mass
 -  Finalize energetic unit conversions and estimate cost (J) and SFG (J)
 -  Write methods for the paper on how these estimates were done. 
		
## III.	Overall Goals This Year..

(1)	Coding and energetics skills
i. Develop a pipeline for energetics modeling code so it can be easily reused. Include reference to published code in manuscript.   
i. Develop expertise in new statistical and ecological modeling methods. Include analyses using these methods in manuscript. 
i. Reading: Atlantic surfclam population and growth models
NOTE: I recently attended a course of Bayesian statistical data analysis, in which I learned about using the BRMS package in R studio with a wide range of linear and nonlinear models. 

(2)	Bioinformatics skills
i. Collaborate with bioinformatics experts to gain experience using bioinformatic tools to investigate gene expression. 
i. Iterpret TaqSeq data and write a manuscript of the findings using this new array of skills
i. Reading: general transcriptomics / gene expression networks 
NOTE: I recently finalized two post-doc applications proposing work with ddRADseq and methyl-ATAC-seq. I also have a free RRBS kit from Zymo in Putnam Lab that I could give a try funds and time permitting.

(3)	Apply to professorship / postdoc positions and grants
a.	OAE-PRF NSF postdoc grant application
b.  Seagrant / west coast postdoc grant applications
c.	Search more possibilities and continue the conversation (PIs of interest, etc.)

(4)	Manuscript publication (More detail above)
