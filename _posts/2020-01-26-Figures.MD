### _What are these figures?_

### **Experiment details:**
**Location:** Point Whitney Shellfish Hatchery - Brinnon, Washington, USA

**Objective** Condition postlarval pacific geoduck for three months under ambinet and elevated pCO2 conditions to measure **_physiological, cellular, and molecular_** response under subseqent stress encounters.

_HYPOTHESIS_: **Moderate stress conditioning enhances intragenerational resliance and performance (acclimitization) to cope under subsequent stress encounters of similar or greater intensity**
