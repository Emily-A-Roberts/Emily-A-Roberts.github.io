## Pipeline for geoduck physiology (oxidative stress, total protein, & condition index)
NOTE: the following protocol was followed in analysis of juvenile geoduck (~5-8mm shell length)
from an OA experiment completed in summer 2019. Juvenile geoduck (whole animals) were snap frozen in LN2 at the hatchery
and stored at -80°C until later analysis.

### 1.) Sample prep
#### **Homogenize samples / record homogenate volume(s)**

:**PREPARATION::**
  - label four 1.5 ml epindorf tubes per sample ID (four aliquots of homogenized tissue; n = 4 phys measurements)
  - chill PBS before use
  - use cold beads (stored at -20°C) to hold a 25ml beaker of cold PBS and samples
  - divide bead bin for four tube destinations
  - label four storage boxes for four assays = total antioxidant capcacity (TAC),
  condition index/AFDW (CI), lipid peroxidation (LP), and total protein (TP)

**HOMOGENIZE FROZEN SAMPLES:**

- add **200 µl cold PBS** to the sample tube
- homogenize samples **thoroughly!**
- pipette **600ul cold PBS to rinse** the homogenizer blade **into** the sample tube

*Important note:* volume of PBS used here (e.g. 200 µl + 600 µl = 800 µl) is dependent on
(1) the volume needed per sample in downstream assays and
(2) volume needed to rinse *all* sample from the homogenizer

- **clean homogenizer** - *before every subsequent sample AND when finished...*
submerge the the homogenizer in 25 ml beaker of
DI --> bleach --> DI --> >70% ethanol --> DI. Dry with Kimwipe.
Run the homogenizer for 1-2 seconds before the next sample

:**TOTAL HOMOGENATE VOLUME (HV):**
- *using a 1000 µl (1ml) pipette* **meausure HV** of
the homogenized sample (e.g. homogenized geoduck + 800ul cold PBS; **~800-900 µl**)
- **record** HV and tube/sample ID in datasheet

- pipette four aliquots in **seperate labeled tubes** for the following:

  *IMPORTANT! **vortex** the HV epindorf tube **between each aliquot**!*

    1.) 100ul - **total protein (TP)** need 25 µl per sample in microplate assay (50 µl in duplicate)

    2.) 80ul - **total antioxidant capacity (TAC)** need 20 µl per sample in microplate assay (40 µl in duplicate)

    3.) 350 ul - **lipid peroxidation (LP)** need 300 µl for TBARS acid treatment;
    150ul per sample in microplate assay (300 µl in duplicate)

    4.) 270 - 400 µl - **condition index/AFDW (CI)** the remaining sample can be used for CI
    (e.g. 100 µl(TP) + 80 µl(TAC) + 350 µl(LP) = 530 µl; 800 ul - 530 µl = 270 µl)

- place homoegized samples in labeled storage box and store for later analysis

*Note*: TAC, LP, and TP in -80°C; CI samples can stored in anthing ≤ 4°C

### 2.) Target measurements:
*Q: Why measure oxidative damage and antioxidants?*

 *Review the following:*
- (1) Costantini, D., & Verhulst, S. (2009). Does high antioxidant capacity indicate low oxidative stress?. Functional Ecology, 23(3), 506-509.
-  (2) Monaghan, P., Metcalfe, N. B., & Torres, R. (2009). Oxidative stress as a mediator of life history trade‐offs: mechanisms, measurements and interpretation. Ecology letters, 12(1), 75-92.

### I. Total protein
#### Assay: Pierce(TM) BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific)
- remove taget samples from the -80C and position them on 20C beads

**lyse cells to solubalize insoluble protein (~4-5 hrs)**

- *modified from Kevin H. Wong's Lab Notebook (for coral)* - weblink: https://kevinhwong1.github.io/KevinHWong_Notebook/Total-Protein-Extraction-Protocol/

###### This protocol is adapted to determine total protein content using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit from Thermo Scientific.

1. Thaw homogenized tissues
2. For 200 μL of coral larval tissues, add 10 μL of 1M NaOH (**pH should be ~10**) into each vial
- The vial will be too small to fit a pH probe, therefore pipette a very small amount onto **pH paper**
3. Incubate each vial at **50°C for 4 hours shaking at 300rpm**
4. Add 280 μL of 0.1M HCl to each vial to neutralize the sample
- *Note* - this may not neutralize our sample - **test this with juvenile geoduck and modify protocol**
- Add the HCl in small increments and test pH
pH should be at 7 - use more/less HCl depending on your sample
Ensure pH is at 7 before moving on to the next steps
5. Now use this prepared sample for the BCA protocol.

During the 4 hour incubation, follow the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit instructions to prepare the BSA standards and working reagents. Use the micro plate procedure if using the plate spectrophotometer.

#### Notes on BCA Protein Assay Protocol
- Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA, for standards) - careful pipetting, this bubbles easily and can alter spec results. To avoid this, purge pipette above the meniscus. Also... 200 µl pipette tip does not fit in the albumin container and therfore must be pipetted in smaller aliquots
- Diluent = DI water
- When adding (1) dilent (2) WR reagent to microplate w/multichannel pipette **pipette mix the sample and DO NOT purge below the meniscus**

**Q: What to do with extra standards/when do you make new standards?**
  - although a standrd can be used multiple times (stored at -20 C)....  it is good practice to remake the standard **each time the WR** (working reagent) **is made**
